The current SpendSight project requires comprehensive optimization and issue resolution to ensure it is production-ready, secure, and highly performant. First, remove unnecessary debug code such as console.log statements and debugger; calls, which not only clutter output but can also leak sensitive data. This should be enforced automatically during production builds with linting rules or a Babel plugin. Image optimization is also crucial — compress large assets and convert to WebP format where possible to reduce page load times. To avoid bloated bundles, enable lazy-loading for heavy components such as the expense charts and route-level modules using React’s Suspense. Libraries like recharts, lodash, or moment should be modularized or replaced with lighter alternatives such as chart.js, dayjs, or native JavaScript functions.

Bundle size must be analyzed with tools like Rollup Visualizer to identify oversized dependencies and apply tree-shaking effectively. Production builds should use hashed filenames and long-term caching headers to maximize performance on repeat visits. Static assets should ideally be served through a CDN for speed and reliability. Sensitive files such as .env and .git must be excluded from deployment packages to prevent accidental exposure of secrets. Instead, environment variables should be configured securely in CI/CD pipelines or hosting platforms.

Additionally, responsive design practices should be enforced so the report and analytics pages adapt smoothly across screen sizes. This includes restructuring card layouts, ensuring charts scale dynamically, and making navigation intuitive. Accessibility improvements such as proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation should be included to expand usability.

By addressing debugging artifacts, optimizing assets, modularizing dependencies, implementing code-splitting, securing secrets, and ensuring responsive design, SpendSight will transform into a robust, user-friendly, and high-performing personal finance tracker ready for real-world deployment.
