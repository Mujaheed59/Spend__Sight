AI-Powered Real-Time Expense Tracker (MERN + AI)
🎯 Objective

A full-stack web app where users can:

Track expenses/income.

Get real-time visualizations (weekly/monthly/yearly).

AI automatically categorizes expenses (Food, Travel, Shopping, Bills, etc.).

AI gives budgeting insights & saving recommendations.

🏗️ Core Modules
1. Authentication & User Management

Login/Signup (JWT + bcrypt).

Role-based access (e.g., admin → see all users, normal → own data).

Tech: React (frontend), Express + JWT (backend), MongoDB (users).

2. Expense Management

CRUD operations → Add, edit, delete expenses.

Fields: amount, category, date, description, payment mode (cash/card/UPI).

Store in MongoDB.

Real-time updates with WebSockets/Socket.io (so users see instant changes on dashboard).

3. Data Visualization

Weekly / Monthly / Yearly charts using:

Recharts / Chart.js / D3.js (React frontend).

Pie chart (category split), Line graph (trend), Bar chart (monthly spend).

4. AI Integration (Smart Categorization + Insights)

Categorization:

User types expense → AI auto-classifies (e.g., "Starbucks Coffee" → Food & Drinks).

Model: Pre-trained NLP classifier (BERT / HuggingFace) or OpenAI API.

Smart Insights:

"You spent 30% more on Food compared to last month."

"If you reduce dining out, you can save ₹2,000/month."

AI generates budget suggestions.

5. Reports & Export

Generate weekly/monthly PDF reports with expense breakdown.

Export CSV/Excel for tracking.

Share via email (NodeMailer).

6. Optional Add-ons for Scale

OCR Integration → Scan bills/receipts → auto-add to database.

Bank SMS/UPI integration → Parse expenses directly.

Notifications → Email / Push notifications for overspending alerts.

Gamification → Rewards/badges for saving goals.

⚙️ Tech Stack
Frontend (React.js)

React + Redux Toolkit (state management).

TailwindCSS / Bootstrap (UI).

Chart.js / Recharts (graphs).

Socket.io-client (real-time updates).

Backend (Node.js + Express.js)

REST API for expenses, users, reports.

JWT authentication.

Socket.io for real-time sync.

NodeMailer for reports/email alerts.

Database (MongoDB + Mongoose)

Collections:

users (id, email, password, profile info).

expenses (userId, category, amount, date, paymentMode).

insights (userId, recommendations, savings tips).

AI/NLP

Option 1: HuggingFace NLP model for text classification (categorizing expenses).

Option 2: OpenAI/Gemini API for insights & recommendations.

Option 3: Train small ML model (sklearn, TensorFlow) → host via FastAPI & connect to MERN backend.

🚀 Deployment

Frontend: Vercel / Netlify.

Backend: Render / Railway / AWS EC2.

Database: MongoDB Atlas (cloud).

AI Model: Hosted on HuggingFace Spaces / AWS Lambda / FastAPI microservice.

📊 Example User Flow

User logs in → Dashboard loads with last month’s chart.

User adds: “Swiggy ₹500”.

AI categorizes → Food & Dining.

Updates chart instantly via Socket.io.

At month-end → AI generates insight:

“Your spending increased 15% in July vs June. Biggest rise: Travel.”
